        <p class="text-compress-580">
          Quak is aiming to create relationships between businesses who need to advertise their product/service AND those who have audience on social media and willing to be paid to help business reach more users and increase the accuracy of the advertisement.

Providing the best place for the content creators, public figures, gaming streamers, etc to have a stable and safe income stream in exchange for creating sponsored content for the businesses.
